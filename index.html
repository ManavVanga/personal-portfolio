            about: `I am a biomedical engineering professional passionate about transforming advanced research into practical, scalable solutions for human health. My expertise spans CRISPR gene editing, cell line establishment, 3D bioprinting, and organoid platform development, enabling the creation of reproducible, high-fidelity models for drug discovery, toxicity testing, and disease modeling.

            I currently operate as an Associate at Bioprinting Laboratories Inc., where I lead efforts in high-throughput drug screening, assay development, and product commercialization. I have successfully optimized and scaled proprietary pillar/perfusion plate platforms from lab to market launch, ensuring quality control and reproducibility at the production scale.

            I resolve problems at the intersection of science and engineering whether it's improving the predictability of preclinical testing, streamlining manufacturing processes, or integrating cutting-edge biotechnologies to meet industry and academic needs. My work has contributed to NIH-funded projects, collaborations with global biotech partners, and publications in top-tier journals such as Lab on a Chip and ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering.

            I bring value through a combination of technical mastery, operational efficiency, and cross-functional collaboration. With hands-on experience in stem cell culture, iPSC-derived organoids, immunofluorescence, ELISA, qPCR, and microscopy, I lead and drive laboratory expertise with strategic product development.

            I am driven by the belief that science should not just answer questions but deliver solutions. Open to connecting with biopharma, health, and research leaders seeking to advance translational medicine, accelerate discovery, and bring meaningful innovations to market.`,

This technology facilitates the rapid, uniform seeding of organoids onto the pillar plate, maintaining cell viability and enabling the scale-up generation of HLOs. The assay-ready pillar plate with HLOs is suitable for compound testing, as well as in situ organoid staining and analysis."

Here, we demonstrate a novel 3D cell culture platform, combined with 144-perfusion plate formats, 144PillarPlate, 384PillarPlate and a complementary 144-perfusion plate with perfusion wells and reservoirs (144PerfusionPlate) for dynamic 3D cell culture and predictive compound screening. To accelerate biomarker timely response, small Hep3B liver tumor spheroids suspended in alginate were printed and encapsulated on the 144PillarPlate rapidly by using microgravity large spheroids in the 144PillarPlate and bioprinted Hep3B spheroids on the 144PillarPlate were dynamic cultured with minimal manual intervention. The bioprinted Hep3B spheroids are viable and demonstrate to determine the cancer spheroids to facilitate 50% of the cell dynamic testing of anticancer drugs with decreased sensitivity."
